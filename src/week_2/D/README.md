## Problem Statement  
One hot summer day, Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon.  
They chose the biggest and ripest one, in their opinion. After weighing it, the scales showed **w** kilos.  

They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the watermelon.  
However, they faced a hard problem:  

Pete and Billy are great fans of **even numbers**, so they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that:  
- Each of the two parts weighs an **even number** of kilos.  
- Each part has a **positive weight**.  
- The parts do **not** have to be equal.  

Help them determine whether it's possible to divide the watermelon as they wish.  

## Constraints  
- **1 ≤ w ≤ 100**  
- **w** is an integer.  

## Input  
The first (and only) input line contains an integer **w**, the weight of the watermelon.  

## Output  
Print `"YES"` if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing an **even** number of kilos.  
Otherwise, print `"NO"`.
